MONGODB-EXPRESS-REACT-NODE.JS  PROJECT

This is a full stack project in which users can register and create hiking events.
If you are logged in you can create a new hike and see list of created hikes by all the users.
You can click on any one and see details.
If you are the one who created the hike you can edit or cancel that hike.
You can not make any changes to other users' hikes. 
Will add a checklist for day hikes and a weather page to see the weather conditions in any location you search when you want to join a hike.
